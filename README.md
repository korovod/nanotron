<p>Pretraining & finetuning models made easy
</h3>


Nanotron is a library for pretraining transformer models. It provides a simple and flexible API to pretrain models on custom datasets. Nanotron is designed to be easy to use, fast, and scalable. It is built with the following principles in mind:

- **Simplicity**: Nanotron is designed to be easy to use. It provides a simple and flexible API to pretrain models on custom datasets.
- **Scalability**: Nanotron uses the latest techniques to train models more efficiently at scale.
- **Speed**: This version of Nanotron focuses on HPC-oriented optimizations, typically made available via C++ extensions.

## Installation

We recommend using [Spack](https://spack.io/) to install this version of Nanotron.

```bash
git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true --depth=2 https://github.com/spack/spack.git
git clone https://github.com/korovod/korovod-spack-packages.git
cd spack/bin
./spack repo add korovod-spack-packages
./spack install py-nanotron
```

> [!TIP]
> It is advised to maintain a proper [Spack environment](https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_environments.html) to ensure reproducibility.

To install a C++ extension, simply use the corresponding Spack variant:

```bash
./spack install py-nanotron +py-datastates
```

> [!TIP]
> We log to wandb automatically if it's installed (and the command above will install it). If you don't want to use wandb, you can run `wandb disabled`.

## Quick Start

First, have a look at the **[Ultrascale Playbook](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/ultrascale-playbook)**, a comprehensive guide to efficiently scale LLM training with Nanotron.

### Predicting the memory that you will need

A good starting point is to understand the memory usage from model configurations. The Nanotron team created [a tool](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nanotron/predict_memory) for this purpose. Just paste your YAML configuration to generate memory diagrams.

### Training a tiny Llama model

The following command will train a tiny Llama model on a single node with 8 GPUs. The model will be saved in the `checkpoints` directory as specified in the config file.
```bash
CUDA_DEVICE_MAX_CONNECTIONS=1 python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=8 run_train.py --config-file examples/config_tiny_llama.yaml
```

### Run generation from your checkpoint

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.run --nproc_per_node=1 run_generate.py --ckpt-path checkpoints/10/ --tp 1 --pp 1
# We could set a larger TP for faster generation, and a larger PP in case of very large models.
```

### Custom examples

You can find more examples in the [`/examples`](/examples) directory:
<!-- Make a table of the examples we support -->
| Example | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `custom-dataloader` | Plug a custom dataloader to nanotron |
| `datatrove` | Use the datatrove library to load data |
| `doremi` | Use DoReMi to speed up training |
| `mamba` | Train an example Mamba model |
| `moe` | Train an example Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model |
| `mup` | Use spectral µTransfer to scale up your model |
| `s3` | For automatically uploading checkpoints to S3 |

We're working on adding more examples soon! Feel free to add a PR to add your own example. 🚀

## Features

We currently support the following features:

- [x] 3D parallelism (DP+TP+PP)
- [x] Expert parallelism for MoEs
- [x] AFAB and 1F1B schedules for PP
- [x] Explicit APIs for TP and PP which enables easy debugging
- [x] ZeRO-1 optimizer
- [x] FP32 gradient accumulation
- [x] Parameter tying/sharding
- [x] Custom module checkpointing for large models
- [x] Spectral µTransfer parametrization for scaling up neural networks
- [x] Mamba example
- [x] Asynchronous checkpointing

And we have on our roadmap:

- [ ] Data-parallel checkpointing for reducing I/O pressure
- [ ] FP8 training
- [ ] Bucketed ZeRO-1
- [ ] ZeRO-3 optimizer (a.k.a FSDP)
- [ ] `torch.compile` support
- [ ] Ring attention
- [ ] Interleaved 1f1b schedule
- [ ] Interleaved offloading of ZeRO states
- [ ] Efficient expert parallelism

## Models

The following models are currently supported:

- Mistral 7B
- Qwen2
- Llama 3.2
- Llama 3.1
- StarCoder2

We thank the Hugging Face team for their work on the [original project](https://github.com/huggingface/nanotron).

We would like to thank everyone working on LLMs, especially those sharing their work openly from which we took great inspiration: Nvidia for `Megatron-LM/apex`, Microsoft for `DeepSpeed`, HazyResearch for `flash-attn`, ANL for `datastates`.
